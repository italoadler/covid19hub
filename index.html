                <p>Charts which simply show the change in confirmed deaths over time are not very useful to answer the question of how the <em>speed</em> 
                of the outbreak compares between different countries. 
                This is because the outbreak of COVID-19 did not begin at the same time in all countries.</p>
                <p>This chart here is designed to allow such comparisons.</p>         
                <p>The trajectory for each country begins on the day when that country had&nbsp;5 confirmed deaths.</p>
                <p>This allows you to compare how rapidly the number of confirmed deaths increased after the outbreak reached a similar stage in each country.</p>
                <p><strong>The grey lines in the background help you to see how rapidly the number of confirmed deaths is increasing</strong><br>These lines show the 
                    trajectories for doubling times of 1, 2, 3, 5, 
                    and 10 days. If the slope that a country is on is steeper than a particular grey line, then the doubling time of confirmed cases in that country is 
                    faster than that. For example, there are several countries for which 
                    the slope was steeper than the ‘…every 2 days’ line – this means their case count doubled faster than every two days.
